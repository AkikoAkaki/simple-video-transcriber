# Meeting Transcriber

A personal Windows tool that turns OBS meeting recordings, iPhone Voice Memos, and other audio/video into Markdown with timestamps and speaker labels. Transcripts are kept for reference and agent context. Recognition runs locally; initial model downloads require internet access. The tool does not summarize, rewrite, or infer speaker names.

[中文说明](README.zh.md)

## Use

- **Manual files:** run `start.bat` or click the tray icon, select or drop one or more files in the dashboard, and click **Transcribe**. Files run sequentially with the same language, speaker-count, and terminology settings for the batch.
- **OBS recordings:** select the recording folder and enable **Watch in background**. The watcher handles new files appearing while it is running, not an existing archive. Disable it when unnecessary.
- **Agents / CLI:** call `transcribe.py`. It uses the same pipeline as the dashboard. Success exits with code 0; failure exits with a nonzero code.

**Title** is optional and sets the Markdown heading and filename. For a batch it prefixes each source filename. Output names retain source fingerprints to distinguish replaced files such as repeated `New Recording 4` recordings. CLI: `--title "CSC290 Lecture 3"`.

Double-click a recent task or click **Open result** to open its Markdown. **Retry** requeues a failed or cancelled task with its original settings and the current token. The source recording must still exist and match the original file version; import a replaced recording as a new task. Transcripts moved into Obsidian are not tracked or automatically recreated.

**Full pipeline** includes speaker diarization. Save a HuggingFace token in the dashboard and accept the terms for [speaker-diarization-3.1](https://hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1) and [segmentation-3.0](https://hf.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0). Without a token or valid diarization cache, or if loading or diarization fails or returns no speaker turns, the task fails and does not publish a new Markdown transcript.

Choose **Transcribe only** explicitly for recordings known to contain one speaker when labels are unnecessary. Use **Full pipeline** for lectures with student interaction, seminars, and meetings. Leave speaker counts automatic unless known; **Exact speakers** takes precedence over **Max speakers**. **Names / terms** provides recognition hints, not verified speaker identities.

## Install and start

Requires Windows, Python 3.10+, and ffmpeg. `install.bat` checks Python, attempts to install missing ffmpeg through winget, and installs `requirements.txt` into `.venv`. Then run `start.bat`.

To start the tray at login:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup_autostart.ps1
```

Append `-Uninstall` to remove autostart. This script manages autostart; `config.py` does not.

## Command line

Use the Python environment containing the dependencies, such as `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` after running the installer:

```powershell
python transcribe.py "lecture.m4a" --language en
python transcribe.py "meeting.mp4" --num-speakers 3 --hotwords "vLLM,KV Cache"
python transcribe.py "solo-lecture.m4a" --transcribe-only
python transcribe.py "meeting.mp4" --diarize-only
```

`--diarize-only` reuses Whisper results matching the current recognition settings; matching diarization results are also reused. Keep recognition caches when retrying failures. Overrides include `--model large-v3`, `--device cpu`, `--max-speakers 3`, and `--output-dir ./transcripts`. CLI token sources include the dashboard store, the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable, and `config.py`.

## Files and settings

- `transcripts/`: a staging folder for results you can rename and archive in Obsidian. Markdown is fully written before replacing the destination; write failures preserve the existing file. Archives are not automatically moved or deleted.
- `cache/`: intermediate audio and recognition, diarization, and merged results. **Clear Audio Cache** removes only audio associated with terminal jobs, preserving JSON and Markdown.
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%/SimpleVideoTranscriber/`: dashboard settings, the job database, and text logs. Existing historical event tables remain intact but receive no new events.

`config.py` supplies defaults. The tray uses settings saved by the dashboard; CLI arguments override the corresponding defaults. The default model is `large-v3-turbo`, with `large-v3` also available; the default device is `auto`. The watch folder defaults to the user's Videos directory and can be changed in the dashboard or defaulted through `MEETING_TRANSCRIBER_WATCH_DIR`.

Transcription settings are captured when a task is queued. Missing tokens fail early unless a valid diarization cache exists. Matching recognition and diarization caches bypass audio extraction and model execution.

The watcher waits for roughly 15 seconds of stable file size and checks whether the file can be opened. This is a recording-completion heuristic; paused recordings or transfers can trigger early. Source audio/video is neither moved nor deleted, and media links are not added automatically.
